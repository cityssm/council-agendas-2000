Marie has been more proactive than most Ontario Cities and has committed up to $10 million towards the implementation of hospital restructuring; and Whereas discussions with Ministry officials suggest that our Hospital Board enter into continual immediate negotiations to determine a final price and sign off from the Ministry on the “Functional Program” of the restructuring implementation; and  Whereas the Super Build Infrastructure Program has a finite budget and any further   delays   in   the   process   may   hinder   our   City’s   ability   to   access   the necessary funding to achieve our goal of providing the best healthcare facilities to our residents; and  Whereas any delay only protracts the time period which could preclude the completion   of   critical   healthcare   components   such   as   the   radiotherapy   unit (cancer bunker);  Therefore Be It Resolved that a Committee of Council composed of the Mayor and two Councillors (Vaudry and Pascuzzi) be struck and they as well as the Commissioner of Finance be delegated to consult with the Boards of the Sault Area Hospitals on how best to move forward expediently and strategically in discussions with the Ministry of Health to effect the most desirable hospital facility that the citizens of Sault Ste.

Now therefore be it resolved that City Council receives with thanks, a copy of the petition and adds its support for Dr. McAllister’s return as a matter of sound future manpower planning and that such support is based on the following:  1)   Dr.   McAllister’s   return   is   supported   by   the   hospital’s   Departments   of Orthopaedics and its orthopaedic surgeons;  2)   The existing orthopaedic surgeons are prepared to share existing O.R. time and hospital privileges without encroaching on the time or privileges of any other specialty or medical department.  3)   There are no issues outstanding regarding proficiency or competence, and  4)   Dr. McAllister is prepared to make a long term commitment to practicing in our community.
